have you ever wanted to know what it

   
feels like to have your bottom

   
penetrated by the pointed bony

   
projections of a mythical animal of

   
course you do

   
this is max chameleon and this is little

   
chameleon welcome to the first audio

   
review for carnal chameleon with ya

   
so we're going to try this it's a little

   
bit different I'm getting sick and tired

   
of writing and that's cool i'll still be

   
doing some written things on the website

   
you know for the special subjects that

   
sort of thing but I figured we try to

   
reviews a lot more fun and the will of

   
course be transcripts available on the

   
website so that you know if you like

   
reading stuff that will be there this

   
just helps us stay a little bit more

   
motivated so up first we have the

   
unicorn horn by split peaches as you

   
know we hear carbon Community have a

   
thing for fantasy toys and of course

   
this toy being a unicorn horn it's a

   
fantasy fantasy toy

   
it was also a gift from our good friend

   
and transsexuals co-host curious so

   
thank you thank you can't a lot of fun

   
so what's going to unicorn horn

   
well you should be asking what unicorn

   
horn is going in you

   
unicorn horn by slip peaches is made out

   
of platinum silicon version that we have

   
is a six inch version but they also come

   
in eight inch in 11 inch version but oh

   
my goodness that is really big 11 inches

   
yeah i don't i don't think i said that i

   
prefer the small pony sized the unicorns

   
over the full-size unicorns this toy has

   
a great shape as you'd expect from a

   
unicorn horn it features basically two

   
rounded bands at twist along the outside

   
and paper a bit the quote-unquote point

   
is actually fairly rounded and not at

   
all Tucker inducing your corn also

   
features a nice layered base you'll end

   
up losing this mythical creature in your

   
Underwood i really like this toy the

   
shape is settled and very gentle for my

   
pains Cooper which we all know Mac that

   
yes yes we always talk about the pins

   
super the ribs are smooth and help

   
ripples it slides in

   
course they also twist in a screen

   
formation so the unicorn board can be

   
twisted one way easier insertion and the

   
other for fun sensation my favorite part

   
being tagged by my sweet little unicorn

   
nothing is more exciting than seeing

   
your coming at me with the horn attached

   
to the harness I bowed to my unicorn

   
goddess you want you tell us a little

   
bit of what do you think well it's a

   
great little toy for both backend and

   
friend place for me i found it most

   
enjoyable in the back in play

   
that is to say it's still enjoyable in

   
the friend I just preferred in the back

   
as an amazing experience the blunt tip

   
made for easy entry into both back and

   
front and play the colors that story is

   
really awesome and love the metallic

   
look to any training a little sparkle

   
wish there was a little bit more Sparkle

   
but subtlety is always good bit more

   
unicorn magic

   
yeah I could be a little bit more

   
unicorn magic going in anatomy also have

   
some peaches also offers rainbow-colored

   
toys which is of course funny because

   
the whole thing with unicorns pooping

   
rainbows unicorns and rainbows and

   
sprinkles

   
yeah I actually quite enjoyed it

   
conclusions with peaches toys are right

   
up our alley beans fun colors and

   
perhaps a little less than a hundred

   
percent serious this is how we like our

   
toys the Unicorn is a great purchase

   
even if you don't plan on using it for

   
the bedroom you can always mount it in

   
your living room and talk about your

   
days is a unicorn hunter and for that i

   
do recommend the 11-inch yeah that's a

   
good point you want to go for the big

   
usually go for the big unicorns if

   
you're going to be taking them out so

   
that just about does it for us today

   
this is max community and this is Lily

   
chameleon remember always be yourself

   
unless you could be unicorn then

   
obviously you should we be a unicorn
